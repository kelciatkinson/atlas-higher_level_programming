## 0-positive_or_negative.py
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

You can find the source code here
The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
You don’t have to understand what import, random. randint do. Please do not touch this code
The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ ./0-positive_or_negative.py 
-4 is negative
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ ./0-positive_or_negative.py 
0 is zero
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ ./0-positive_or_negative.py 
-3 is negative
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ ./0-positive_or_negative.py 
-10 is negative
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ ./0-positive_or_negative.py 
10 is positive

## 1-last_digit.py
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

You can find the source code here
The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
You don’t have to understand what import, random.randint do. Please do not touch this code. This line should not change: number = random.randint(-10000, 10000)
The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by
the number, followed by
the string is, followed by the last digit of number, followed by
if the last digit is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if the last digit is 0: the string and is 0
if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
followed by a new line
